# Multi layer LSTM model for MNIST

Deep neural networks course assignment.

Two layer LSTM network is implemented, which reliably achieves 0.97 accuracy on the test set.

Augmentation is also implemented as per the task specification, but it (expectedly) slows down the training process,
so it is commented out for the demonstration.

The loss function is softmax.
